# Build Changelog

`build-changelog` is a tool to simplify changelogs. To create a new entry in the changelog create a
new `yaml` file.

Examples:

```yaml
# test-change.yml
added:
  - "You can add a change by adding a string to the the valid properties."
  - Quotes are optional

removed:
  breaking:
    - if you have a breaking change you can use the breaking property to have the prefix.
```

## Valid Keywords

- `added`
- `changed`
- `deprecated`
- `removed`
- `fixed`
- `security`
